// You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of
// substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

// For example, given:
// s: "barfoothefoobarman"
// words: ["foo", "bar"]

// You should return the indices: [0,9].
// (order does not matter).

public:
    vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        
    }
